### Update in the following version.
The most sustainable way of eating involves reducing your consumption of animal products, minimizing food waste, and choosing foods that are local, seasonal, and minimally processed. A sustainable diet is primarily plant-based, focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, while limiting red meat and dairy. 

Additional practices include avoiding plastic packaging, drinking tap water, and shopping in bulk to reduce waste.  

Shift to a plant-based diet
Eat more plants: 
Animal-based foods like red meat and dairy typically have a higher environmental impact than plant-based foods. 

Prioritize plant proteins: 
Build meals around fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, nuts, and lentils. 

Reduce food waste
Choose sustainable products and practices

Eat local and seasonal: 
Opt for produce that is grown locally and in season to reduce transportation emissions. 

Minimize packaging: 
Avoid single-use plastics by choosing products with less packaging. 

Grown with a low environmental impact.
